# StrategyPatternUseCase
A simple implementation of the Strategy Design Pattern in Java with Unit Tests

A BookShelf contains Books. Books are made up of a title and a length (the number of pages in them).
A BookShelf can be sorted using two different strategies, sorting by length from smallest to largest (LengthSort) and sorting
alphabetically by title (TitleSort).
